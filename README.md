## 🛑 What is Lumo?

**Lumo** is a browser-based traffic light simulator that lets you explore how real-world traffic signals work — and what happens when they *don’t*!  
Built with **React**, **CSS animations**, and the **Web Audio API**, it offers a smooth and engaging experience for both learners and tinkerers.

Whether you're teaching students about traffic rules, experimenting with UI state, or just love seeing chaos unfold at intersections — **Lumo’s got you.**

## 🚦 Core Features

| 🔍 Feature            | 💥 Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖐️ Manual Mode       | Control each light yourself — red, yellow, green. You're the traffic cop now! |
| ⏳ Auto Cycle         | Set custom timers to watch the system run on its own.                          |
| 🤯 Chaos Mode        | Lights go *wild* — simulating real-world signal failures.                      |
| 🎨 Smooth Animations | Transitions are buttery smooth with CSS animations.                            |
| 🔊 Realistic Sounds  | Pedestrian crossing beeps using Web Audio API.                                 |
